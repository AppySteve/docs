- **Behavior**: Update instructions, tools, skills, and integrations
- **Skills**: Update instructions and associated tools
- **Personalization**: Update settings
- **Triggers**: Change how customers interact with your agent

**2. Test with Preview**

Hit **Publish** to make your changes live for customers, with optional release notes to communicate updates.

## Version Control & Release Notes

**Track All Changes**

Every publish creates a new version with a complete change log. You can see exactly what modified between versions - whether it's behavior updates, new skills, or appearance changes.

**Customer Communication**

When publishing updates, add release notes to keep your customers informed about improvements and new features. This builds trust and helps customers understand new capabilities.

## States

**Unpublished**\
Your agent starts unpublished, allowing unlimited experimentation without affecting customer experience. Make changes to behavior, add new tools, adjust triggers, or modify appearance before available to customers.

**Published**\
Once published, your agent becomes available to customers at your unique URL. Published agents can accept subscriptions and process payments, making this your production environment.

**Pending Changes**\
Your initial published version remains available to customers while you make changes to your agent. When you chose to publish again, your customers are notified of the updates and see your new version.

## Getting Started

**For New Agents**

1. Build and test your agent thoroughly in draft mode
2. Complete billing setup and pricing configuration
3. Publish your first version to start accepting customers

**For Existing Agents**

1. Make changes confidently in draft mode
2. Use preview to validate updates
3. Prepare release notes highlighting customer benefits
4. Publish when ready, knowing you can roll back if needed

Your publishing workflow ensures customers always receive a polished, tested experience while giving you the freedom to iterate and improve continuously.
