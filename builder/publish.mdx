## Distribution options

AppyAI offers three ways to distribute your agent:

| Mode | Who uses it | Authentication | Payment | Plan required |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| **Beta share** | Testers | None | None | Any |
| **Free subscribers** | Customers | Required | None | Pro+ |
| **Paid subscribers** | Customers | Required | Required | Scale |

## Share for beta testing

Before publishing, you can share your agent with anyone for testing and feedback. Testers access your agent via a share link - no account creation required.

**How to share:**
1. Toggle sharing on in your agent settings
2. Copy the share URL
3. Send to friends, colleagues, or beta testers

<Note>
  Shared agents are for testing only. Testers won't have accounts, preferences, or interaction history.
</Note>

## Publish your agent

Publishing makes your agent available at your custom URL (`yoursubdomain.appy.ai`). Subscribers create accounts and get the full experience with personalization, interaction history, and support.

### Free agents (Pro and Scale plans)

Publish without setting up monetization. Subscribers authenticate and create accounts but don't pay.

1. Build and test your agent in draft mode
2. Publish your agent
3. Promote via your custom agent URL
4. Subscribers sign up and start using your agent

### Paid agents (Scale plan only)

Add monetization to charge for access. Requires Stripe setup.

1. Build and test your agent in draft mode
2. [Set up monetization](/builder/monetize) via Stripe
3. Set your pricing (monthly, annual, free trials)
4. Publish your agent
5. Promote via your custom agent URL
6. Subscribers authenticate, pay, and create accounts

## Safe development workflow

**1. Make changes in draft** 

Modify any aspect of your agent while in draft mode:

- **Behavior**: Update instructions, tools, skills, and integrations
- **Skills**: Update instructions and associated tools
- **Personalization**: Update settings
- **Triggers**: Change how customers interact with your agent

**2. Test with Preview**

**3. Publish when ready**

Hit **Publish** to make your changes live for customers, with optional release notes to communicate updates.

## Version control & release notes

**Track all changes**

Every publish creates a new version with a complete change log. You can see exactly what modified between versions - whether it's behavior updates, new skills, or appearance changes.

**Customer communication**

When publishing updates, add release notes to keep your customers informed about improvements and new features. This builds trust and helps customers understand new capabilities.

## States

**Shared**\
Your agent is available via share link for beta testing. Testers don't need accounts.

**Unpublished**\
Your agent starts unpublished, allowing unlimited experimentation without affecting customer experience. Make changes to behavior, add new tools, adjust triggers, or modify appearance before available to customers.

**Published**\
Once published, your agent becomes available to subscribers at your unique URL. Depending on your plan and settings, published agents can be free or accept subscriptions and process payments.

**Pending changes**\
Your initial published version remains available to customers while you make changes to your agent. When you chose to publish again, your customers are notified of the updates and see your new version.

<Tip>
  **Publishing cadence**

  - **Bug fixes**: Publish immediately after testing
  - **Minor improvements**: Bundle into regular updates
  - **Major features**: Announce in advance and provide detailed release notes
  - **Breaking changes**: Communicate well in advance when possible
