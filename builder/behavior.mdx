## Instructions: Your Agent's Brain

The Instructions box is where you tell your agent what to do and how to behave. Write in plain English - no coding required\! This is like having a detailed conversation with a really smart assistant about exactly how you want them to help your customers.

### What to Include in Instructions

- **What your agent does**: Clearly explain the main purpose and goals
- **How it should behave**: Define the tone, personality, and approach
- **Step-by-step processes**: Walk through your methodology or workflow
- **Important context**: Include key information your agent needs to know

### Tips for Great Instructions

- Be specific about what you want your agent to accomplish
- Include examples of good responses when possible
- Mention any important rules or limitations
- Write like you're training a new team member

### Skills: Your Custom Capabilities

Skills are custom capabilities you create when you need your agent to do something specific that requires detailed instructions. Create a new skill when:

- You have a complex sub-process that needs lots of detailed guidance
- You want to isolate a specific, repeatable task
- The main instructions are getting too long and complex

Think of skills as specialized jobs your agent can do - like "analyze a business proposal" or "create a workout plan."

### Tools: Built-in Superpowers

Tools are ready-made capabilities we've built for you, like:

- **googleSearch**: Let your agent search the web for current information
- **userChat**: Enable back-and-forth conversations with users
- **websiteScraper**: Pull information from websites automatically
- **Browser Use**: Control a web browser to complete tasks
- **Email sending**: Send professional emails on your behalf

Simply click to add any tools your agent needs to accomplish its goals.

## How It All Works Together

Your agent reads its instructions, then automatically decides which skills and tools to use based on what the user needs. You don't have to manage when or how - just give good instructions and select the right capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. **Start with clear instructions** about your agent's main purpose
2. **Add essential tools** like userChat and googleSearch
3. **Test your agent** to see how it performs
4. **Refine and add skills** as needed for complex tasks

<Tip>
  Remember: Always come back and adjust your agent's behavior as you learn what works best\!
