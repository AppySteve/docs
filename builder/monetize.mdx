## Getting Started with Monetization

When you're ready to launch your agent publicly, you'll complete a quick approval process through Stripe (our payment processor) right within the AppyAI platform. Once approved, you can set your pricing and start accepting customers immediately.

<Note>
  **Platform Fee**: AppyAI takes a 10% fee on each transaction to cover platform costs and support.

## Setting Your Pricing

Configure exactly how you want to charge for access to your agent.

### Subscription Options

**Monthly Pricing**: Set your base monthly subscription rate in USD

**Annual Pricing (Optional)**: Offer an annual option with built-in savings for customers who commit longer-term

**Free Trials (Optional)**: Lower the barrier to entry with trial periods:

- No free trial
- 7, 14, or 30-day free trials
- Customers get full access during trial, then automatically convert to paid subscription

Free trials are highly recommended since they let potential customers experience your agent's value before committing to pay.

## Managing Your Business

Once revenue starts rolling, we provide you with all of the tool needed to manage the financial health of your AI business. Stripe provides:

- **Payments** - Track all incoming payments from your customers, including subscription renewals, trial conversions, and any failed payments that need attention.
- **Payouts**- Monitor your earnings and payout schedule. See your total balance, available funds, and when your next payout is scheduled. Payments are automatically transferred to your bank account on a regular schedule.
- **Pricing** - Adjust your subscription rates, trial periods, and pricing as your business grows.
- **Documents** - Access invoices, tax documents, and other financial records for your business accounting needs.
- **Taxes** - Manage tax information and compliance requirements based on your location and business structure.
- **Account** - Update your business details, banking information, and account settings for payment processing.

## Launch When You're Ready

There's no rush to monetize immediately. Many builders prefer to:

1. **Test thoroughly** with friends, colleagues, or beta users
2. **Refine the agent** based on feedback
3. **Set competitive pricing** after understanding the value you provide
4. **Launch publicly** when you're confident in the experience

Your agent can remain private and free while you perfect it, then switch to paid subscriptions whenever you're ready to start generating revenue.

## Success Tips

- **Start with a free trial** to reduce signup friction
- **Price based on value delivered**, not just time saved
- **Monitor your metrics** to understand customer behavior
- **Adjust pricing** as you learn what works in your market
