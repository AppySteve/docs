## User Initiated

This is the default trigger that lets customers manually start conversations or tasks with your agent. Perfect for chat-based agents where users come with questions or need help with something specific.

Most agents use this trigger since it allows for natural back-and-forth conversations whenever users need assistance.

## Recurring Schedule

Set your agent to run automatically at regular intervals - perfect for ongoing tasks like monitoring, reporting, or routine maintenance.

**Use Case Example**: A news summarization agent that runs every morning to compile and send daily industry updates.

### Schedule Options

- **Date & Time**: Choose when to start the recurring schedule
- **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, or monthly execution
- **Timezone**: Automatically uses your account timezone (MDT shown in example)

## Email Triggers

<Warning>
  Email triggers are temporarily unavailable. We plan to have these available again soon.
</Warning>

Turn any email into an agent activation. When someone sends an email to your agent's unique address, it automatically triggers a new execution using the email content as input.

**Email Address**: AppyAI generates a unique email address for your agent (like `samuraize-4elX2z@mail.appypeople.ai`). You can share this with clients or use it in automated workflows.

**Use Case Example**: A content summarization agent that automatically processes and responds to articles or documents sent via email.

## Combining Triggers

You can enable multiple triggers for the same agent. For example, a reporting agent might run automatically every week but also allow users to manually request reports when needed.

## Configure with Violet (Chat)

<img

  alt="Screenshot 2025-12-10 at 10.35.58 AM.png"
  style={{ width:"83%" }}
/>

Ask Violet to set up your triggers in natural conversation:

- "I want my agent to send a daily report every morning at 8am"
- "Enable user chat and also run a weekly summary on Mondays"
- "Change my daily schedule to 6am instead of 8am"

Violet handles the configuration automatically and confirms changes with you.

## Configure Manually
