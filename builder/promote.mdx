## Link types

AppyAI provides different URLs depending on how you want to distribute your agent:

| Link type | Purpose | Requirements |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Share link** | Beta testing | Sharing enabled |
| **Subscriber URL** | Free or paid signups | Published agent |

## Share link for beta testing

Before publishing, share your agent with testers who can use it without creating an account.

1. Enable sharing in your agent settings
2. Copy the share link
3. Send to anyone you want to test your agent

<Note>
  Share links are for testing only. Testers won't have accounts, preferences, or interaction history.
</Note>

## Subscriber URL

Your published agent gets its own landing page at `yourorganization.appy.ai` where customers can learn about and sign up for your agent.

**For free agents:** Subscribers authenticate and create accounts - no payment required.

**For paid agents:** Subscribers authenticate, select a plan, and pay via Stripe.
