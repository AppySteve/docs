## Redirect URLs for Brand Continuity

Keep customers in your brand ecosystem even after they interact with your agent.

### Redirect URL

When customers sign out from your agent or complete certain authentication flows, they'll be automatically sent to a URL you specify. This could be:

- Your main business website homepage
- A thank-you page acknowledging their session
- A contact page encouraging further engagement
- Any other page that keeps them connected to your brand

This ensures customers don't just disappear after using your agent - they stay within your business ecosystem where you can continue building the relationship.

## Your Agent's Home

Your agent automatically gets its own landing page at a subdomain `yourorganization.appy.ai` where customers can learn about and sign up for your agent. This gives you a complete presence even if you don't have your own website yet.
