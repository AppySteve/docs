### Sign Up Link

Send this link to new prospects who need to create an account to access your agent. Perfect for:

- Email marketing campaigns
- Social media posts
- Website buttons or call-to-action links
- Direct outreach to potential customers

### Login Link

Share this with existing customers who already have accounts but need a direct way to access your agent.

## How to Use Your Links

**Share Directly**: Copy and paste your links into emails, messages, or social media to reach potential customers immediately.

**Add to Your Website**: If you already have a business website, add these links as buttons or embedded links to drive your existing traffic to your agent.

Many builders integrate these links into their current marketing funnel, making it easy for existing customers and website visitors to discover and sign up for their AI agent.

## Brand Continuity with Redirect URLs

Keep customers in your brand ecosystem even after they interact with your agent.

### Logout Redirect URL

When customers sign out from your agent or complete certain authentication flows, they'll be automatically sent to a URL you specify. This could be:

- Your main business website homepage
- A thank-you page acknowledging their session
- A contact page encouraging further engagement
- Any other page that keeps them connected to your brand

This ensures customers don't just disappear after using your agent - they stay within your business ecosystem where you can continue building the relationship.

## Your Agent's Home

Your agent automatically gets its own landing page at a subdomain like `your-business.appy.ai` where customers can learn about and sign up for your agent. This gives you a complete presence even if you don't have your own website yet.
