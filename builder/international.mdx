- **Get Paid Locally** - Receive payouts in your country's currency

## How It Works

**During Onboarding** When you first sign up for [Appy.AI](http://Appy.AI), you'll select your country. This determines your payout currency and cannot be changed later, so make sure you choose correctly!

**During Monetization** When you're ready to start earning, head to **Build → Monetization** and set your pricing. You'll enter the amount you want to charge in your local currency—the one tied to the country you selected during onboarding.

That's it! We handle all the payment configuration automatically based on your country.

## Quick FAQs

**What currency will I be paid in?** You'll receive payouts in your country's default currency. For example, if you're in Canada, you'll be paid in Canadian Dollars (CAD).

**What currency will my subscribers pay in?** They'll pay in the same currency you receive. So if you're paid in euros, your subscribers pay in euros too.

**Can I change my country after onboarding?** No, your country selection is permanent and cannot be changed once set during onboarding.
