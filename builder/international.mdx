## What This Means for You

When you set up monetization for your agent, we'll ask you to select your country. This simple step unlocks:

- **Get Paid Locally** - Receive payouts in your country's currency
- **Simplified Setup** - We automatically configure everything based on your location
- **Local Payment Methods** - Your subscribers can pay using methods familiar to them

No currency conversions to worry about, no complicated configurations—just straightforward payments in the currency you use every day.

## How It Works

**During Onboarding** When you first sign up for [Appy.AI](http://Appy.AI), you'll select your country. This determines your payout currency and cannot be changed later, so make sure you choose correctly!

**During Monetization** When you're ready to start earning, head to **Build → Monetization** and set your pricing. You'll enter the amount you want to charge in your local currency—the one tied to the country you selected during onboarding.

That's it! We handle all the payment configuration automatically based on your country.

## FAQs

**What currency will I be paid in?** You'll receive payouts in your country's default currency. For example, if you're in Canada, you'll be paid in Canadian Dollars (CAD).

**What currency will my subscribers pay in?** They'll pay in the same currency you receive. So if you're paid in euros, your subscribers pay in euros too.

**Can I change my country after onboarding?** No, your country selection is permanent and cannot be changed once set during onboarding.
