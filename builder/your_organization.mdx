### Organization Branding

**Logo Upload**: Add your organization's logo to create a consistent brand experience

- Recommended size: 1:1 aspect ratio, up to 10MB
- Supports common image formats (PNG, JPG)

**Organization Name**: Set the display name that represents your organization across AppyAI

**Organization Slug**: Modify the URL where your published agent will be hosted ([SLUG].appy.ai)

### Verified Domains

**Automatic Access**: Allow users with verified email domains to join your organization automatically or request access

- Add your company's email domain (e.g., @[yourcompany.com](http://yourcompany.com))
- Users with matching email addresses can join without individual invitations
- Reduces administrative overhead for larger teams
- Maintains security by limiting access to verified domain holders

<Tip>
  **Domain Benefits**: Verified domains make it easier for legitimate team members to discover and join your organization while keeping unauthorized users out.
</Tip>

## Team Member Management

Build and manage your collaborative workspace by controlling who has access to your organization and what role they play.

### Current Members

View and manage all active members in your organization. The member count shows your current team size, and you can see each member's role and permissions at a glance.

### Inviting New Members

**Email Invitations**: Send invitations directly through the platform

- Enter one or more email addresses, separated by spaces or commas
- Choose the appropriate role for new members (Member, Admin, etc.)
  - Admins can invite additional members to your organization
- Invitations are sent automatically with instructions for joining

**Pending Invitations**: Track outstanding invitations that haven't been accepted yet

- Monitor which team members still need to join
- Resend invitations if needed
- Cancel invitations that are no longer needed

### Join Requests

**Request Management**: Handle requests from users who want to join your organization

- Review incoming requests from potential team members
- Approve or decline requests based on your organization's needs
- Maintain control over who gains access to your workspace
