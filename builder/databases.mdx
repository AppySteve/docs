## What Are Databases?

Databases let your agent collect, store, and retrieve structured information during conversations. Instead of just remembering random details, your agent organizes data into clean, searchable tables that create lasting value for both you and your customers.

## How Databases Work

When you set up Data Tables, your agent automatically knows what information to collect and how to store it. As customers share details during conversations, your agent saves relevant data to the appropriate fields. Your customers can then recall and update their information directly through the agent chat - making your AI feel more like a personalized app than just a chatbot.

  In the near future, we'll let you give your customers access to their data right within the interface. Move from background memory to a functional app for them to edit and add data\!

## Setting Up Your First Data Table

1. **Navigate to Databases** in the build tab
2. **Create a new table** and give it a descriptive name
3. **Add fields** using the field types that match your data needs:
   - Short text, Long text, Numbers, Currency, Percentages
   - Dates, Phone numbers, Email addresses, URLs
   - Checkboxes, Single select, Multiple select options
4. **Add the  tag** to your agent instructions - this tells your agent to use the databases feature

## When to use databases

**Important Date Tracking**\
Set up tables for birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasions. Your agent remembers when customers mention these dates and can proactively remind them or offer relevant services at the right time.

**Client Relationship Management**\
Track company details, decision makers, project timelines, and interaction history. Your agent builds a comprehensive client profile over time, making every conversation more personalized and informed.

**Social Media Calendar Management**\
Create structured content calendars with post dates, content types, platforms, and approval status. Your agent helps customers plan, organize, and track their social media strategy while keeping everything easily accessible.

## Getting Started

- Think about both the data your agent will generate and the data it will interact with over multiple interactions
- Create a data table and include the essential fields 
- Add 3-4 essential fields, add the {database} tag to your instructions
- Test it with a few conversations to discover additional fields you and your customers want to collect.

You're on your way to giving your customers a perfect memory to store their work and make their lives easier\!
