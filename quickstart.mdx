## Launch in minutes, not months

The entire process from start to finish:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Create your agent" icon="user-robot">
    Chat to describe what your user does and how it behaves. Write in plain English - no technical skills required.

    Violet, your chat co-pilot will help you:

    - **Add Skills & Tools**: Select from our library of built-in tools  and create custom skills for specialized tasks your agent needs to perform.
    - **Set Up Personalization**: Configure the preferences you want to collect from customers during their onboarding to make every interaction perfectly tailored.

    **Test Your Agent**: Use the "Preview" feature to experience your agent exactly as your customers will, directly in the subscriber experience
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Share for beta testing (optional)" icon="share-nodes">
    Before publishing, get feedback from friends, colleagues, or beta testers.

    - **Enable sharing** in your agent settings
    - **Copy the share link** and send to anyone
    - **No account required** - testers can use your agent immediately

    Perfect for validating your agent before going live.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 3: Publish your agent" icon="rocket-launch">
    One-Click Launch. Hit the publish button to make your agent live and available for subscribers.

    - **Free agents**: Subscribers create accounts and use your agent at no cost (Pro and Scale plans)
    - **Paid agents**: Set up [monetization](/builder/monetize) first to charge subscribers (Scale plan only)
    - **Instant Availability**: Your agent is immediately ready to serve subscribers once published.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 4: Promote and grow" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    Use the signup URL from the Promote section to drive subscribers to your agent.

    - **Custom URL**: Your agent lives at `yoursubdomain.appy.ai`
    - **Scale from Day One**: The platform handles all the technical complexity, so you can serve one subscriber or thousands with the same effort.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What happens next

Once published, you can:

- Monitor subscriber signups and interactions in the Engage section
- Track revenue and manage payouts in the Monetize section (Scale plan)
- Refine your agent based on feedback and usage patterns
- Scale your marketing efforts using the professional links provided

## Two modes: Chat (Violet) or Manual

As you work with your agent, you can move between using a chat to easily update your agent, or viewing a manual-UI to change aspects of your agent's behavior:

1. Chat with Violet, your co-pilot via the chat panel on the left
2. Click the eye icon to preview how your agent looks and functions
3. Toggle between your agent home, your website, and other aspects of your customers' experience
4. Click into manual mode to see the specific prompts and settings that are driving your agent

## Pro tips for quick launch

- **Start Simple**: Begin with core functionality and add complexity as you learn what subscribers need most.
- **Use Preview Extensively**: Test every aspect of your agent before publishing to ensure a smooth experience.
- **Share First**: Get feedback from beta testers before publishing to subscribers.
- **Price Confidently**: If monetizing, you can always adjust pricing based on subscriber response and value delivered.
