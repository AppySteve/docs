## Smart Support Routing

### Technical Issues → AppyAI Team

**Report an Issue**: When subscribers encounter technical problems, platform errors, or agent malfunctions, these tickets are automatically routed to the AppyAI technical team.

- Platform bugs and system errors
- Agent performance issues
- Login or access problems
- Payment processing errors
- Any technical malfunction

**You Stay Focused**: Technical issues are handled completely by AppyAI, so you never have to troubleshoot platform problems or explain system errors.

### Business Questions → You (The Builder)

**Ask a Question** and **Product Suggestions**: Customer questions about your expertise, agent capabilities, or business-related inquiries come directly to you.

- Questions about your methodology or approach
- Requests for additional agent features
- Business or domain-specific inquiries
- Feedback about agent responses
- Suggestions for improvements

## Why This System Works

### For Your Business

- **Focus on Expertise**: You only handle questions related to your domain knowledge and business - never technical issues.
- **Professional Image**: Subscribers see a complete support system, not a one-person operation trying to handle everything.
- **Reduced Burden**: Technical problems are someone else's responsibility, freeing you to focus on customer success and agent improvement.
- **Better Response Times**: Technical issues get immediate attention from people who built the platform, while you can focus on thoughtful responses to business questions.

### For Your Subscribers

- **Always Supported**: No matter what type of issue they have, there's a clear path to resolution.
- **Professional Service**: Enterprise-grade support experience with proper categorization and routing.
- **Quick Resolution**: Technical issues get resolved by the people who know the platform best, while business questions go to the domain expert (you).

## The Support Experience

Subscribers simply select their support type and submit their request. The system automatically routes it to the right team, ensuring they get expert help whether it's a technical glitch or a question about your expertise.

This professional support structure builds confidence and reduces churn - subscribers know they'll always get help when they need it, without you having to become a technical support specialist.
