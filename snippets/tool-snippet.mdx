<Accordion title="User Chat" icon="message">
    ### What it does

    User Chat enables your agent to have interactive conversations with users, just like ChatGPT or Claude. Instead of only running automated processes, your agent can respond to questions, provide guidance, and engage in back-and-forth dialogue while still having access to all its tools and knowledge.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Some problems require conversation - users need to ask follow-up questions, provide additional context, or get personalized guidance that changes based on their specific situation. User Chat transforms your agent from a one-way automation into an interactive assistant that can adapt and respond to each user's unique needs.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where User Chat might come in handy:

    - **Consulting and advice** - Answer questions about your expertise area and provide personalized recommendations
    - **Document analysis** - Let users upload files (PDFs, images, audio, video) and get instant insights or feedback
    - **Interactive planning** - Guide users through complex decisions with back-and-forth conversation
    - **Educational support** - Teach concepts by answering questions and adapting explanations to user understanding
    - **Problem-solving assistance** - Help users work through challenges step-by-step with real-time guidance

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a business consultant who created an agent called "Strategy Advisor." Instead of just generating automated reports, users can have conversations like: "I'm thinking about expanding to a new market - what should I consider?" Your agent asks clarifying questions about their business, industry, and goals, then users can upload their financial statements or market research. Through the conversation, your agent provides tailored strategic advice, answers follow-up questions, and helps them think through the decision - creating a much more personalized and valuable experience than any automated report could provide.

<Accordion title="Google Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    ### What it does

    Google Search gives your agent the ability to find current information from across the internet, just like when you search on Google yourself. Your agent can automatically search for specific topics, gather the latest information, and use those results to provide up-to-date, comprehensive answers to your users.

    ### Why you'd use it

    The internet contains a wealth of current information that changes daily - news, trends, pricing, research, and industry updates. Google Search lets your agent tap into this real-time knowledge to provide accurate, current responses instead of being limited to older information.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where the Web Search might come in handy:

    - **Current events** – Get the latest news, updates, or developments in your industry or area of expertise
    - **Market research** – Find recent trends, competitor information, or industry reports published online
    - **Fact checking** – Verify current statistics, dates, or claims with up-to-date search results
    - **Local information** – Search for location-specific data, businesses, or regional insights
    - **Research assistance** – Gather multiple sources and perspectives on topics your users ask about

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a financial advisor who created an agent called "Market Update Assistant." A client asks: "What's happening with interest rates this week and how might it affect my mortgage?"

    Your agent uses Google Search to find the latest Federal Reserve announcements, recent news articles about rate changes, and current mortgage rate trends from multiple financial sources. It then synthesizes this real-time information into a personalized analysis for your client - giving them insights based on the very latest market developments, not outdated information.

  <Accordion title="Website Scraper" icon="code">
    ### What it does

    Website Scraper automatically collects and organizes information from web pages, so your agent can gather fresh data from across the internet without manual copying and pasting. Think of it as having a research assistant that can instantly read and extract specific information from any website.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Many valuable insights live on websites - competitor pricing, industry news, research data, or market trends. Instead of manually visiting dozens of sites and copying information, Website Scraper lets your agent automatically gather this information and use it to provide up-to-date, comprehensive responses to your users.

<Accordion title="Browser Use" icon="browser">
    ### What it does

    Browser Use gives your agent the ability to control a web browser just like a human would - clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating between pages, and even logging into password-protected systems on your behalf. Think of it as having a digital assistant who can perform any task you could do in a web browser.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Many business tasks require interacting with websites that can't be accessed through simple data collection - submitting forms, managing accounts, updating information in web-based systems, or performing multi-step processes that require navigation. Browser Use lets your agent handle these complex web interactions automatically.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where Browser Use might come in handy:

    - **System updates** - Log into business platforms to update listings, profiles, or account information across multiple sites
    - **Data entry** - Fill out forms, submit applications, or input information into web-based systems

    ### Real-world scenario

    Your agent uses Browser Use to automatically log into each directory site with the stored credentials, navigate to the business profile section, update the hours of operation, phone number, and service descriptions, and confirm the changes - completing in 30 minutes what would normally take hours of repetitive manual work.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="File System" icon="file-contract">
    ### What it does

    File System allows your agent to create documents, reports, and other written materials that users can view, edit, and download. Think of it as your agent's ability to 'write things down' - creating organized, editable documents that capture insights, analysis, or any written work your agent produces.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Sometimes the best way to deliver value is through a well-organized document that users can reference, modify, and keep. Instead of just providing answers in conversation, File System lets your agent create professional documents that users can edit to fit their exact needs, save for later reference, and share with others.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where the File System might come in handy:

    - **Reports and analysis** – Generate comprehensive reports that users can review, edit, and customize before using
    - **Plans and strategies** – Create detailed plans or roadmaps that users can modify and adapt to their specific situation
    - **Templates and frameworks** – Build reusable documents that users can personalize for their own projects
    - **Research summaries** – Compile findings and insights into organized documents for easy reference
    - **Collaborative content** – Create drafts that users can refine and polish through direct editing

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a business coach who created an agent called "Growth Planning Assistant." When a client asks for a marketing strategy, your agent doesn't just chat about ideas - it creates a comprehensive marketing plan document with sections for target audience, messaging, tactics, and timelines.

    The client can then directly edit the document to adjust strategies, add their own insights, modify timelines, or customize sections to match their brand voice. They can save their changes, download the final plan as a PDF to share with their team, and return to reference or update it anytime. This creates a tangible, actionable deliverable that goes far beyond a simple conversation.
  </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="File Converter" icon="code-compare">
    ### What it does

    File Converter gives your agent the ability to transform files between different formats automatically - converting documents, images, audio, video, spreadsheets, and presentations into the exact format your users need. With support for over 200 file formats, your agent can handle virtually any conversion request seamlessly.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Users often have files in one format but need them in another for specific purposes - PDFs for sharing, JPEGs for web use, MP3s for audio playback, or Word docs for editing. Instead of asking users to find conversion tools themselves, File Converter lets your agent handle these transformations instantly as part of delivering complete solutions.

    ### Suggested use cases

    - **Document standardization** - Convert various document formats (Word, Google Docs, PDFs) into consistent formats for processing or sharing

    Your agent uses File Converter to automatically create multiple versions: a compressed JPEG for email newsletters, a vector SVG for web use, a PDF for print materials, and a smaller PNG for social media profiles. Instead of the client having to find conversion tools and figure out optimal settings for each use case, they receive a complete package of properly formatted assets ready for immediate use across all their marketing channels.

  <Accordion title="Send Email" icon="paper-plane">
    ### What it does

    Send Email allows your agent to automatically create and send professional, rich HTML emails to your users. Your agent can use email templates you provide or generate completely custom emails on the fly, including images, formatting, links, and personalized content - all without you having to manually write or send anything.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Email is often the perfect way to deliver results, updates, or ongoing value to your users. Instead of requiring them to constantly check back for updates or manually sending notifications yourself, Send Email lets your agent proactively reach out with timely, relevant, and beautifully formatted messages that keep your users engaged and informed.

    ### Suggested use cases

    When your agent finds matching dogs, it automatically sends a delightful HTML email featuring photos of available pets, their stories, compatibility notes, and helpful adoption tips. The email might include a fun dog fact, local shelter events, and direct links to schedule visits - creating an engaging, valuable touchpoint that helps connect families with their perfect companion while showcasing your expertise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="HTTP" icon="globe-pointer">
    ### What it does

    HTTP allows your agent to connect and communicate with other software platforms you already use - like your CRM, project management tools, email marketing systems, or any service that offers an API. Your agent can automatically send information to these platforms or pull data from them as part of its workflows.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Your business probably uses multiple tools that don't naturally talk to each other. Instead of manually copying information between systems or running separate processes, HTTP lets your agent work seamlessly across your entire software ecosystem - updating your CRM when it finds new leads, adding tasks to your project management tool, or syncing data between platforms automatically.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where HTTP might come in handy:

    - **CRM integration** - Automatically add new contacts, update deal statuses, or log interaction notes in your sales system
    - **Project management** - Create tasks, update project statuses, or sync information with tools like Notion, Linear, or Asana
    - **Data synchronization** - Keep information consistent across multiple platforms without manual copying
    - **Workflow automation** - Trigger actions in one system based on events or data from your agent
    - **Reporting integration** - Pull data from various sources to create a comprehensive markdown report

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a sales consultant who created an agent called "Lead Qualification Assistant." When your agent research potential clients from various sources, instead of just creating a report, it automatically adds qualified prospects to your CRM with all their details, creates follow-up tasks in your project management tool, and updates your email marketing platform to add them to the appropriate nurture sequence.

    Note: This tool requires obtaining API keys from the services you want to connect to, which involves some technical setup, but no coding is required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memory" icon="lightbulb">
    ### What it does

    Memory gives your agent the ability to remember and learn from previous interactions with users across multiple sessions. Instead of starting fresh every time, your agent can recall user preferences, past conversations, and important context to provide increasingly personalized and relevant responses over time.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Traditional AI interactions feel repetitive because the agent forgets everything after each conversation. Memory transforms your agent from a forgetful assistant into a knowledgeable partner that builds relationships with users, remembers their unique situations, and provides continuity across all interactions - making each conversation more valuable than the last.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where Memory might come in handy:

    - **Ongoing coaching relationships** - Remember client goals, progress, challenges, and preferences to provide consistent guidance over time
    - **Customer service continuity** - Recall previous support interactions, known issues, and customer preferences to resolve problems faster
    - **Personalized recommendations** - Learn user preferences and behaviors to suggest increasingly relevant options and solutions
    - **Educational support** - Track learning progress, strengths, weaknesses, and preferred teaching styles for more effective instruction
    - **Long-term project assistance** - Maintain context about ongoing projects, decisions made, and evolving requirements across multiple sessions

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a business strategist who created an agent called "Growth Planning Assistant." A client first discusses their goal to expand into European markets, mentioning they're risk-averse and prefer gradual growth. Three weeks later, they return asking about partnership opportunities.

    Instead of starting from scratch, your agent remembers their expansion goals, risk tolerance, and previous discussions. It can immediately suggest partnership strategies that align with their conservative approach and European focus, building on previous conversations to provide increasingly sophisticated and personalized strategic advice - creating the feeling of working with a trusted advisor who truly knows their business.
