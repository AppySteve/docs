  <Accordion title="Browser Use" icon="browser">
    ### What it does

    Browser Use gives your agent the ability to control a web browser just like a human would - clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating between pages, and even logging into password-protected systems on your behalf. Think of it as having a digital assistant who can perform any task you could do in a web browser.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Many business tasks require interacting with websites that can't be accessed through simple data collection - submitting forms, managing accounts, updating information in web-based systems, or performing multi-step processes that require navigation. Browser Use lets your agent handle these complex web interactions automatically.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where Browser Use might come in handy:

    - **System updates** - Log into business platforms to update listings, profiles, or account information across multiple sites

    - **Multi-step processes** - Complete complex online procedures that require multiple clicks, form submissions, and page navigations

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a marketing consultant who created an agent called "Directory Management Assistant." You need to keep your clients' business information updated across 20 different local directory websites, each requiring login credentials and manual form updates.

    Your agent uses Browser Use to automatically log into each directory site with the stored credentials, navigate to the business profile section, update the hours of operation, phone number, and service descriptions, and confirm the changes - completing in 30 minutes what would normally take hours of repetitive manual work.

  <Accordion title="File System" icon="file-contract">
    ### What it does

    File System allows your agent to create documents, reports, and other written materials that users can view, edit, and download. Think of it as your agent's ability to 'write things down' - creating organized, editable documents that capture insights, analysis, or any written work your agent produces.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Sometimes the best way to deliver value is through a well-organized document that users can reference, modify, and keep. Instead of just providing answers in conversation, File System lets your agent create professional documents that users can edit to fit their exact needs, save for later reference, and share with others.

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a business coach who created an agent called "Growth Planning Assistant." When a client asks for a marketing strategy, your agent doesn't just chat about ideas - it creates a comprehensive marketing plan document with sections for target audience, messaging, tactics, and timelines.

    The client can then directly edit the document to adjust strategies, add their own insights, modify timelines, or customize sections to match their brand voice. They can save their changes, download the final plan as a PDF to share with their team, and return to reference or update it anytime. This creates a tangible, actionable deliverable that goes far beyond a simple conversation.

Your agent can automatically send information to these platforms or pull data from them as part of its workflows.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Your business probably uses multiple tools that don't naturally talk to each other. Instead of manually copying information between systems or running separate processes, HTTP lets your agent work seamlessly across your entire software ecosystem - updating your CRM when it finds new leads, adding tasks to your project management tool, or syncing data between platforms automatically.

  <Accordion title="Memory" icon="lightbulb">

    Traditional AI interactions feel repetitive because the agent forgets everything after each conversation. Memory transforms your agent from a forgetful assistant into a knowledgeable partner that builds relationships with users, remembers their unique situations, and provides continuity across all interactions - making each conversation more valuable than the last.
