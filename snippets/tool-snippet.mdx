    ### What it does

    File System allows your agent to create documents, reports, and other written materials that users can view, edit, and download. Think of it as your agent's ability to 'write things down' - creating organized, editable documents that capture insights, analysis, or any written work your agent produces.

    ### Why you'd use it

    Sometimes the best way to deliver value is through a well-organized document that users can reference, modify, and keep. Instead of just providing answers in conversation, File System lets your agent create professional documents that users can edit to fit their exact needs, save for later reference, and share with others.

    ### Suggested use cases

    Here are a few of the most common scenarios where the File System might come in handy:

    - **Reports and analysis** – Generate comprehensive reports that users can review, edit, and customize before using
    - **Plans and strategies** – Create detailed plans or roadmaps that users can modify and adapt to their specific situation
    - **Templates and frameworks** – Build reusable documents that users can personalize for their own projects
    - **Research summaries** – Compile findings and insights into organized documents for easy reference
    - **Collaborative content** – Create drafts that users can refine and polish through direct editing

    ### Real-world scenario

    Imagine you're a business coach who created an agent called "Growth Planning Assistant." When a client asks for a marketing strategy, your agent doesn't just chat about ideas - it creates a comprehensive marketing plan document with sections for target audience, messaging, tactics, and timelines.

    The client can then directly edit the document to adjust strategies, add their own insights, modify timelines, or customize sections to match their brand voice. They can save their changes, download the final plan as a PDF to share with their team, and return to reference or update it anytime. This creates a tangible, actionable deliverable that goes far beyond a simple conversation.
